[AIR (Audio Intermediate Representation) DSP Architecture Overview]

Goal: Real-time audio processing architecture with sub-1ms latency using adaptive floating/fixed-point hybrid DSP pipeline, LC3 codec abstraction, and SPIR-V-based quantization.

Note: This is a functional architectural draft collaboratively designed by Jehyun (제현) and GPT-4o via prompt-based vibe-coding.
